## 🔥 Streak Maintenance

**Streaks are POWERFUL** for habit formation.

### How to Maintain a Streak:
1. Hit **80%+ daily score** (800/1000 points)
2. You don't need 100% on everything
3. Focus on your strengths (emails, books, revenue)
4. Even 50% on each = 500 points (won't count for streak)

### What Breaks a Streak:
- Skipping a day (0 points)
- Scoring <80% (<800 points)

### Recovery Plan:
- If you break a streak, start fresh next day
- Your **longest streak** is still saved!
- Use it as motivation to beat your record
